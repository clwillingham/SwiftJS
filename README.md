SwiftJS
==========
SwiftJS is an MVC framework with the goal of making sense.

Why?
---------
when i first started figuring out MVC Frameworks, i started with rails. From what i originally heard about rails, you'd think it was the most magical awesome framework in the world...
one flaw, to a noob just getting into Ruby, Rails is ridiculously complicated and large. If you know how to use rails, you can make anything in a few hours. if your new to rails though, your pretty much doomed.
then i got into Node and Expressjs. Express is simple, insanely fast, easy to use and really good for small projects that don't have a lot of routes.
Once you start making more complex projects with express though, you'll find yourself basically making your own MVC framework for each project.
I've looked a lot, there are a lot of different MVC frameworks for rails and NodeJS, but none of them really have the flexibility and simplicity i was looking for.
SailsJS is probably the closest to what i wanted, but i wanted something a little simpler. So i made SwiftJS (originally called ExpressMVC until i found out that already exists)

How?
